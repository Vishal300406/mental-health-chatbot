# mental-health-chatbot
Building an empathetic chatbot that talks to users, recognizes their emotional state from text, and offers supportive responses or resources â€” not just answering but caring.
It will:

Understand if the user is sad, stressed, anxious, happy, etc.

Reply accordingly with positivity, resources, or just empathetic listening.

Keep conversations private and secure.
